/**
 *    Backend Storage Spooler
 *    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * This is the entry point to the general file processing facility of the CVMFS
 * backend. It works with a two-stage approach:
 *
 *   1. Process file content
 *      -> create smaller file chunks for big input files
 *      -> compress the file content (optionally chunked)
 *      -> generate a content hash of the compression result
 *
 *   2. Upload files
 *      -> pluggable to support different upload pathes (local, S3, ...)
 *
 * There are a number of different entities involved in this process. Namely:
 *   -> Spooler            - general steering tasks ( + common interface )
 *   -> IngestionPipeline  - chunking, compression and hashing of files
 *   -> AbstractUploader   - abstract base class for uploading facilities
 *   -> concrete Uploaders - upload functionality for various backend storages
 *
 * Stage 1 aka. the processing of files is handled by the IngestionPipeline,
 * since it is independent from the actual uploading this functionality is
 * outsourced. The IngestionPipeline will take care of the above mentioned steps
 * in a concurrent fashion. This process is invoked by calling
 * Spooler::Process(). While processing, the IngestionPipeline immediately
 * schedules Upload jobs in order to push data to the backend storage as early
 *  as possible.
 *
 * Stage 2 aka. the upload is handled by one of the concrete Uploader classes.
 * Uploaders have a thin interface described in the AbstractUploader class.
 * The IngestionPipeline uses a concrete Uploader to push files into the backend
 * storage as part of it's processing.
 * Furthermore the user can directly upload files using the Spooler::Upload()
 * method as described in the next paragraph.
 *
 * For some specific files we need to be able to circumvent the
 * IngestionPipeline to directly push them into the backend storage (i.e.
 * .cvmfspublished). For this Spooler::Upload() is used. It directly schedules
 * an upload job in the used concrete Uploader facility. These files will not
 * get compressed or check-summed by any means.
 *
 * In any case, calling Spooler::Process() or Spooler::Upload() will invoke a
 * callback once the whole job has been finished. Callbacks are provided by the
 * Observable template. Please see the implementation of this template for more
 * details on usage and implementation.
 * The data structure provided by this callback is called SpoolerResult and con-
 * tains information about the processed file (status, content hash, chunks, ..)
 * Note: Even if a concrete Uploader internally spawns more than one upload job
 *       to send out chunked files, the user will only see a single invocation
 *       containing information about the uploaded file including it's generated
 *       chunks.
 *

 * TODO(rmeusel): special purpose ::Process...() methods should (opionally?)

 *                somewhat one-shot calls and require a rather fishy idiom when
 *                using callbacks, like:
 *
 *                   cb = spooler->RegisterListener(...certificate_callback...);
 *                   spooler->ProcessCertificate(...);
 *                   spooler->WaitForUpload();
 *                   spooler->UnregisterListener(cb);
 *                   cert_hash = global_cert_hash;
 *
 *                   void certificate_callback(shash::Any &hash) {
 *                     global_cert_hash = hash;
 *                   }
 *
 *                If ProcessCertificate(), ProcessHistory(), ProcessMetainfo(),
 *                UploadManifest() and UploaderReflog() would return Future<>,
 *                the code would be much more comprehensible and free of user-
 *                managed global state:
 *
 *                   Future<shash::Any> fc = spooler->ProcessCertificate(...);
 *                   cert_hash = fc.get();
 *
