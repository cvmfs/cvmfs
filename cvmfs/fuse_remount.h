/**
 * Orchestrates an orderly remount of a new snapshot revision in the Fuse
 * module.  Remounting always happens as a result of calling Check() followed
 * by a call to TryFinish().  The Check() method is either called from the
 * remount trigger or from the TalkManager.  The TryFinish() method is either
 * called from a fuse callback function or from CheckSynchronously().  If a new
 * root file catalog is available online and the kernel caches got flushed, the
 * actual heavy-lifting of applying the new catalog takes place in TryFinish();
 *
 * Remounting is inherently asynchronous because the kernel caches need to be
 * flushed.  We do this through the FuseInvalidator.  Once the FuseInvalidor
 * is ready (either by waiting or by active eviction), we flush all user-level
 * caches and reload a new root catalog.
