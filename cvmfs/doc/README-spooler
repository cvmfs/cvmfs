# CVMFS Spooler Location - Quick Reference #
############################################

This directory is used by the CernVM-FS Server tools for book keeping of repos-
itories on the release manager machine or respectively the stratum 0.

WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE ANY MANUAL INTERVENTION IN THE DIRECTORIES BELOW!!

The directory `/var/spool/cvmfs` contains a sub-directory for each repository
managed on this release manager machine. These sub-directories are named with
the fully qualified name of the correlated repository.

/var/spool/cvmfs
             |
             +--> foo.cern.ch
             |
             +--> bar.desy.de
             |
             +--> ...

Each of these repository-specific directories house a number of administrative
structures. A user should not need to interact with them, nevertheless we
provide a quick overview over their purpose in this README.
Since CernVM-FS Server 2.1.x the server tools incorporate a CernVM-FS client
that reflects the current state of the maintained repository. Hence, everything 
that has been published is stored solely in CernVM-FS's backend storage and be-
comes visible through a CernVM-FS client only.
Utilizing a union file system (AUFS) we allow for file system updates directly
on top of the CernVM-FS client. Hence, a CernVM-FS Server does not directly
mount the CernVM-FS client in /cvmfs/foo.cern.ch but through a a writable AUFS
overlay (copy-on-write semantics).

Below is an overview over the contents of the sub-directories found here:
/var/spool/cvmfs/foo.cern.ch/<object>

-> rdonly/         The mount point of the CernVM-FS client for foo.cern.ch. This
                   reflects the current content of the repository as it would be
                   seen by any ordinary CernVM-FS client.
     
-> scratch/        The writable space of the AUFS overlay. Every modification
                   applied to /cvmfs/foo.cern.ch after starting a transaction
                   with `cvmfs_server transaction` is scratched in this direc-
                   tory. In idle state, this directory should be empty. If a
                   transaction was successfully published, `cvmfs_server publish`
                   will automatically flush this directory.
     
-> cache/          This houses the cache for the CernVM-FS client mounted at
                   rdonly/, it contains the same structures as a normal CernVM-
                   FS client cache.
     
-> tmp/            Some `cvmfs_server` actions need scratch space to put tempo-
                   rary files. If no cvmfs_server command is running, this
                   directory is supposed to be empty.

-> client.local    The configuration file for the CernVM-FS client mounted at
                   rdonly/. Usually this should contain a CVMFS_ROOT_HASH with
                   the root catalog hash of the latest published revision.

-> in_transaction/ This is a flag directory that is created when invoking
                   `cvmfs_server transaction`. It just states that the reposi-
                   tory is currently in a transaction.

-> is_publishing/  Before running the actual publishing process during the run
                   of `cvmfs_server publish` this flag directory is created. It
                   is used to safe-guard potential concurrent publishing actions
                   from one another.
