/**
 * A RelaxedPathFilter works similar to a Dirtab but it matches more generously:
 * in addition to the actual paths it represents, all parent paths are matched.
 * Sub paths of given paths are matched, too.  In contrast to Dirtab, trailing
 * slashes of path specifications are ignored.
 *
 * For instance:
 *   /software/releases
 *   ! /software/releases/misc
 *   ! /software/releases/experimental/misc
 *
 * Results in the following positive matches
 *   /software, /software/releases, /software/releases/v1,
 *   /software/releases/experimental
 * and in the following non-matches
 *   /software/apps, /software/releases/misc, /software/releases/misc/external,
 *   /software/releases/experimental/misc,
 *   /software/releases/experimental/misc/foo
 *
 * It is used by cvmfs_preload as a specification of a partial subtree for
 * synchronization with a cache directory.
