/**
 * Fills an ever-growing heap.  Free calls simply mark a block as free but
 * allocation continues to take place at the top of the heap.  Hence Realloc()
 * is inefficient.  For the common pattern of doubling a buffer with realloc,
 * twice the final buffer size is required.
 *
 * The allocator is copying and can "garbage collect".  In order to react on the
 * move of a block, a callback can be registered that gets called with the new
 * pointer address.  The user of the MallocHeap has to make sure to identify
 * any block based on the first bytes.  Therefore, allocation requires these
 * first bytes, a user-defined "header" if you will.
 * Note that during a Compact() not even reading from any of the pointers is
 * allowed!
 *
 * MallocHeap is used  by the in-memory object cache.  The header is the
 * object's content hash, so the cache manager can identify any block in its
 * hash table and move the pointers when MallocHeap runs a garbage collection.
 *
 * All memory blocks are 8-byte aligned and they have an 8-byte header
 * containing their size.  The size is negative for free blocks.
