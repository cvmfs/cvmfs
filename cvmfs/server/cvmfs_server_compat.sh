  # Migration History:
  #   2.1.6 -> 2.1.7
  #     -> repository format changed
  #
  #   2.1.7+ -> 2.1.15
  #     -> config files changed (adding client.local)
  #     -> adjustments in /etc/fstab
  #     -> additional statistics counters in file catalogs
  #
  #   2.1.15+ -> 2.1.20
  #     -> replica (i.e. stratum 1) with local upstream storage has
  #        additional apache config for wsgi
  #
  #   2.1.20+ -> 2.2.0-1 (2.2.0-0 was a server pre-release and needs migration)
  #     -> new (mandatory) parameters in client.conf (Stratum 0)
  #     -> adjustments in /etc/fstab
  #     -> CVMFS_AUTO_REPAIR_MOUNTPOINT=true becomes the enforced default
  #     -> Apache configuration updated
  #
  #   2.2.0-1+ -> 2.3.0-1
  #     -> new scratch directory layout (which also effects /etc/fstab)
  #
  #   2.3.0-1+ --> 2.3.3-1
  #     -> update global JSON info if repo was migrated from 2.1.20 or before
  #        (CVM-1159)
  #
  #   2.3.3-1+ --> 137
  #     -> use an arbitrary server layout revision to decouple the creator
  #        version from the software version (CVM-1065)
  #
  #   137 --> 138
  #     -> update apache configs on relevant stratum 1s for better geo api
  #        implementation (CVM-1349)
  #
  # Note: I tried to make this code as verbose as possible
