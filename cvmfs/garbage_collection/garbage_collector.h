/**
 * This file is part of the CernVM File System.
 *
 * The GarbageCollector class is figuring out which data objects (represented by
 * their content hashes) can be deleted as outdated garbage.
 * Garbage collection is performed on the granularity of catalog revisions, thus
 * a complete repository revision is either considered to be outdated or active.
 * This way, a mountable repository revision stays completely usable (no nested
 * catalogs or data objects become unavailable). A revision is defined by it's
 * root catalog; the revision numbers of nested catalogs are irrelevant, since
 * they might be referenced by newer (preserved) repository revisions.
 * Thus, garbage objects are those that are _not_ referenced by any of the pre-
 * served root catalogs or their direct subordinate nested catalog try.
 *
 * We use a two-stage approach:
 *
 *   1st Stage - Initialization
 *               The GarbageCollector is reading all the catalogs that are meant
 *               to be preserved. It builds up a filter (HashFilterT) containing
 *               all content hashes that are _not_ to be deleted
 *
 *   2nd Stage - Sweeping
 *               The initialized HashFilterT is presented with all content
 *               hashes found in condemned catalogs and decides if they are
 *               referenced by the preserved catalog revisions or not.
 *
 * The GarbageCollector is templated with CatalogTraversalT mainly for
 * testability and with HashFilterT as an instance of the Strategy Pattern to
 * abstract from the actual hash filtering method to be used.
