/**

 * pops read jobs from a queue and handles them. Reading of multiple big Files
 * is done concurrently in a sense that new data Blocks for a number of Files
 * are read in a round robin fashion and scheduled for processing.
 * This allows for better parallelism in the processing pipeline since each
 * individual File needs to be processed sequentially. Though data Blocks of
 * different Files are independent of each other and allow for higher throughput.
 *
 * Note: The Reader produces CharBuffers that are passed into the processing
 *       pipeline. The Reader claims ownership of these specific CharBuffers,
 *       thus they need to be released using the Reader::ReleaseBuffer() method!
