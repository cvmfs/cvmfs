/**
 * The MemoryManager uses the sqlite hooks to optimize memory allocations.  It
 * is tuned for reading the cvmfs file catalogs.  It provides a page cache of
 * a few MB, a small scratch space and per-database lookaside buffers.  It also
 * contains a "general purpose" malloc/free implementation tailored to the
 * behavior of sqlite memory allocation.
 *
 * It is implemented as a singleton.  GetInstance() will reserve memory blocks,
 * AssignGlobalArenas will set the global sqlite configuration and
 * CleanupInstance frees the memory blocks.  These three routines are not
 * thread-safe.  AssignGlobalArenas has to be called as first sqlite operation,
 * CleanupInstance has to be called after sqlite3_shutdown.  If the singleton
 * is alive, read-only sqlite databases will automatically use it for their
 * lookaside buffers (see sql.h).  Assignment of lookaside buffers is
 * thread-safe.
