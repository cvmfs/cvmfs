 * some memory and can choose set some metadata such as object type.
 * @p MemoryKvStore takes ownership of the passed-in memory and maintains
 * reference counts for all its objects. Callers must increment the reference
 * count on an entry before reading to ensure that the entry is not removed
 * mid-operation, and decrement the reference count when done. The store
 * can attempt to reduce its size by removing the least recently used
 * entries without any outstanding references.
