# gir -- codespell wants it to be git
# ative -- used in 3 lines, not really sure if there is no ad-hoc semantic
# parm -- used in cvmfs/authz/authz_curl.cc
# numer -- numerator abbreviated in cvmfs/util/platform_osx.h
# quarantaine -- type cripped into a folder name, change is undesired so far into
#                the project, makes it tricky/impossible to distinguish
#                folder name for a generally mistyped word, so ignored altogether
# MSDOS -- used in C-preprocessor directives
