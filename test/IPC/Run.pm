=head1 NAME

IPC::Run - system() and background procs w/ piping, redirs, ptys (Unix, Win32)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   ## First,a command to run:
      my @cat = qw( cat );

   ## Using run() instead of system():
      use IPC::Run qw( run timeout );

      run \@cmd, \$in, \$out, \$err, timeout( 10 ) or die "cat: $?"

      # Can do I/O to sub refs and filenames, too:
      run \@cmd, '<', "in.txt", \&out, \&err or die "cat: $?"
      run \@cat, '<', "in.txt", '>>', "out.txt", '2>>', "err.txt";


      # Redirecting using psuedo-terminals instad of pipes.
      run \@cat, '<pty<', \$in,  '>pty>', \$out_and_err;

   ## Scripting subprocesses (like Expect):

      use IPC::Run qw( start pump finish timeout );

      # Incrementally read from / write to scalars. 
      # $in is drained as it is fed to cat's stdin,
      # $out accumulates cat's stdout
      # $err accumulates cat's stderr
      # $h is for "harness".
      my $h = start \@cat, \$in, \$out, \$err, timeout( 10 );

      $in .= "some input\n";
      pump $h until $out =~ /input\n/g;

      $in .= "some more input\n";
      pump $h until $out =~ /\G.*more input\n/;

      $in .= "some final input\n";
      finish $h or die "cat returned $?";

      warn $err if $err; 
      print $out;         ## All of cat's output

   # Piping between children
      run \@cat, '|', \@gzip;

   # Multiple children simultaneously (run() blocks until all
   # children exit, use start() for background execution):
      run \@foo1, '&', \@foo2;

   # Calling \&set_up_child in the child before it executes the
   # command (only works on systems with true fork() & exec())
   # exceptions thrown in set_up_child() will be propagated back
   # to the parent and thrown from run().
      run \@cat, \$in, \$out,
         init => \&set_up_child;

   # Read from / write to file handles you open and close
      open IN,  '<in.txt'  or die $!;
      open OUT, '>out.txt' or die $!;
      print OUT "preamble\n";
      run \@cat, \*IN, \*OUT or die "cat returned $?";
      print OUT "postamble\n";
      close IN;
      close OUT;

   # Create pipes for you to read / write (like IPC::Open2 & 3).
      $h = start
         \@cat,
            '<pipe', \*IN,
            '>pipe', \*OUT,
            '2>pipe', \*ERR 
         or die "cat returned $?";
      print IN "some input\n";
      close IN;
      print <OUT>, <ERR>;
      finish $h;

   # Mixing input and output modes
      run \@cat, 'in.txt', \&catch_some_out, \*ERR_LOG );

   # Other redirection constructs
      run \@cat, '>&', \$out_and_err;
      run \@cat, '2>&1';
      run \@cat, '0<&3';
      run \@cat, '<&-';
      run \@cat, '3<', \$in3;
      run \@cat, '4>', \$out4;
      # etc.

   # Passing options:
      run \@cat, 'in.txt', debug => 1;

   # Call this system's shell, returns TRUE on 0 exit code
   # THIS IS THE OPPOSITE SENSE OF system()'s RETURN VALUE
      run "cat a b c" or die "cat returned $?";

   # Launch a sub process directly, no shell.  Can't do redirection
   # with this form, it's here to behave like system() with an
   # inverted result.
      $r = run "cat a b c";

   # Read from a file in to a scalar
      run io( "filename", 'r', \$recv );
      run io( \*HANDLE,   'r', \$recv );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IPC::Run allows you to run and interact with child processes using files, pipes,
and pseudo-ttys.  Both system()-style and scripted usages are supported and
may be mixed.  Likewise, functional and OO API styles are both supported and
may be mixed.

Various redirection operators reminiscent of those seen on common Unix and DOS
command lines are provided.

Before digging in to the details a few LIMITATIONS are important enough
to be mentioned right up front:

=over

=item Win32 Support

Win32 support is working but B<EXPERIMENTAL>, but does pass all relevant tests
on NT 4.0.  See L</Win32 LIMITATIONS>.

=item pty Support

If you need pty support, IPC::Run should work well enough most of the
time, but IO::Pty is being improved, and IPC::Run will be improved to
use IO::Pty's new features when it is release.

The basic problem is that the pty needs to initialize itself before the
parent writes to the master pty, or the data written gets lost.  So
IPC::Run does a sleep(1) in the parent after forking to (hopefully) give
the child a chance to run.  This is a kludge that works well on non
heavily loaded systems :(.

ptys are not supported yet under Win32, but will be emulated...

=item Debugging Tip

You may use the environment variable C<IPCRUNDEBUG> to see what's going on
under the hood:

   $ IPCRUNDEBUG=basic   myscript     # prints minimal debugging
   $ IPCRUNDEBUG=data    myscript     # prints all data reads/writes
   $ IPCRUNDEBUG=details myscript     # prints lots of low-level details
   $ IPCRUNDEBUG=gory    myscript     # (Win32 only) prints data moving through
                                      # the helper processes.

=back

We now return you to your regularly scheduled documentation.

=head2 Harnesses

Child processes and I/O handles are gathered in to a harness, then
started and run until the processing is finished or aborted.

=head2 run() vs. start(); pump(); finish();

There are two modes you can run harnesses in: run() functions as an
enhanced system(), and start()/pump()/finish() allow for background
processes and scripted interactions with them.

When using run(), all data to be sent to the harness is set up in
advance (though one can feed subprocesses input from subroutine refs to
get around this limitation). The harness is run and all output is
collected from it, then any child processes are waited for:

   run \@cmd, \<<IN, \$out;
   blah
   IN

   ## To precompile harnesses and run them later:
   my $h = harness \@cmd, \<<IN, \$out;
   blah
   IN

   run $h;

The background and scripting API is provided by start(), pump(), and
finish(): start() creates a harness if need be (by calling harness())
and launches any subprocesses, pump() allows you to poll them for
activity, and finish() then monitors the harnessed activities until they
complete.

   ## Build the harness, open all pipes, and launch the subprocesses
   my $h = start \@cat, \$in, \$out;
   $in = "first input\n";

   ## Now do I/O.  start() does no I/O.
   pump $h while length $in;  ## Wait for all input to go

   ## Now do some more I/O.
   $in = "second input\n";
   pump $h until $out =~ /second input/;

   ## Clean up
   finish $h or die "cat returned $?";

You can optionally compile the harness with harness() prior to
start()ing or run()ing, and you may omit start() between harness() and
pump().  You might want to do these things if you compile your harnesses
ahead of time.

=head2 Using regexps to match output

As shown in most of the scripting examples, the read-to-scalar facility
for gathering subcommand's output is often used with regular expressions
to detect stopping points.  This is because subcommand output often
arrives in dribbles and drabs, often only a character or line at a time.
This output is input for the main program and piles up in variables like
the C<$out> and C<$err> in our examples.

Regular expressions can be used to wait for appropriate output in
several ways.  The C<cat> example in the previous section demonstrates
how to pump() until some string appears in the output.  Here's an
example that uses C<smb> to fetch files from a remote server:

   $h = harness \@smbclient, \$in, \$out;

   $in = "cd /src\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/m;
   die "error cding to /src:\n$out" if $out =~ "ERR";
   $out = '';

   $in = "mget *\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/m;
   die "error retrieving files:\n$out" if $out =~ "ERR";

   $in = "quit\n";
   $h->finish;

Notice that we carefully clear $out after the first command/response
cycle? That's because IPC::Run does not delete $out when we continue,
and we don't want to trip over the old output in the second
command/response cycle.

Say you want to accumulate all the output in $out and analyze it
afterwards.  Perl offers incremental regular expression matching using
the C<m//gc> and pattern matching idiom and the C<\G> assertion.
IPC::Run is careful not to disturb the current C<pos()> value for
scalars it appends data to, so we could modify the above so as not to
destroy $out by adding a couple of C</gc> modifiers.  The C</g> keeps us
from tripping over the previous prompt and the C</c> keeps us from
resetting the prior match position if the expected prompt doesn't
materialize immediately:

   $h = harness \@smbclient, \$in, \$out;

   $in = "cd /src\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/mgc;
   die "error cding to /src:\n$out" if $out =~ "ERR";

   $in = "mget *\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/mgc;
   die "error retrieving files:\n$out" if $out =~ "ERR";

   $in = "quit\n";
   $h->finish;

   analyze( $out );

When using this technique, you may want to preallocate $out to have
plenty of memory or you may find that the act of growing $out each time
new input arrives causes an C<O(length($out)^2)> slowdown as $out grows.
Say we expect no more than 10,000 characters of input at the most.  To
preallocate memory to $out, do something like:

   my $out = "x" x 10_000;
   $out = "";

C<perl> will allocate at least 10,000 characters' worth of space, then
mark the $out as having 0 length without freeing all that yummy RAM.

=head2 Timeouts and Timers

More than likely, you don't want your subprocesses to run forever, and
sometimes it's nice to know that they're going a little slowly.
Timeouts throw exceptions after a some time has elapsed, timers merely
cause pump() to return after some time has elapsed.  Neither is
reset/restarted automatically.

Timeout objects are created by calling timeout( $interval ) and passing
the result to run(), start() or harness().  The timeout period starts
ticking just after all the child processes have been fork()ed or
spawn()ed, and are polled for expiration in run(), pump() and finish().
If/when they expire, an exception is thrown.  This is typically useful
to keep a subprocess from taking too long.

If a timeout occurs in run(), all child processes will be terminated and
all file/pipe/ptty descriptors opened by run() will be closed.  File
descriptors opened by the parent process and passed in to run() are not
closed in this event.

If a timeout occurs in pump(), pump_nb(), or finish(), it's up to you to
decide whether to kill_kill() all the children or to implement some more
graceful fallback.  No I/O will be closed in pump(), pump_nb() or
finish() by such an exception (though I/O is often closed down in those
routines during the natural course of events).

Often an exception is too harsh.  timer( $interval ) creates timer
objects that merely prevent pump() from blocking forever.  This can be
useful for detecting stalled I/O or printing a soothing message or "."
to pacify an anxious user.

Timeouts and timers can both be restarted at any time using the timer's
start() method (this is not the start() that launches subprocesses).  To
restart a timer, you need to keep a reference to the timer:

   ## Start with a nice long timeout to let smbclient connect.  If
   ## pump or finish take too long, an exception will be thrown.

 my $h;
 eval {
   $h = harness \@smbclient, \$in, \$out, \$err, ( my $t = timeout 30 );
   sleep 11;  # No effect: timer not running yet

   start $h;
   $in = "cd /src\n";
   pump $h until ! length $in;

   $in = "ls\n";
   ## Now use a short timeout, since this should be faster
   $t->start( 5 );
   pump $h until ! length $in;

   $t->start( 10 );  ## Give smbclient a little while to shut down.
   $h->finish;
 };
 if ( $@ ) {
   my $x = $@;    ## Preserve $@ in case another exception occurs
   $h->kill_kill; ## kill it gently, then brutally if need be, or just
                   ## brutally on Win32.
   die $x;
 }

Timeouts and timers are I<not> checked once the subprocesses are shut
down; they will not expire in the interval between the last valid
process and when IPC::Run scoops up the processes' result codes, for
instance.

=head2 Spawning synchronization, child exception propagation

start() pauses the parent until the child executes the command or CODE
reference and propagates any exceptions thrown (including exec()
failure) back to the parent.  This has several pleasant effects: any
exceptions thrown in the child, including exec() failure, come flying
out of start() or run() as though they had ocurred in the parent.

This includes exceptions your code thrown from init subs.  In this
example:

   eval {
      run \@cmd, init => sub { die "blast it! foiled again!" };
   };
   print $@;

the exception "blast it! foiled again" will be thrown from the child
process (preventing the exec()) and printed by the parent.

In situations like

   run \@cmd1, "|", \@cmd2, "|", \@cmd3;

@cmd1 will be initted and exec()ed before @cmd2, and @cmd2 before @cmd3.
This can save time and prevent oddball errors emitted by later commands
when earlier commands fail to execute.  Note that IPC::Run doesn't start
any commands unless it can find the executables referenced by all
commands.  These executables must pass both the C<-f> and C<-x> tests
described in L<perlfunc>.

Another nice effect is that init() subs can take their time doing things
and there will be no problems caused by a parent continuing to execute
before a child's init() routine is complete.  Say the init() routine
needs to open a socket or a temp file that the parent wants to connect
to; without this synchronization, the parent will need to implement a
retry loop to wait for the child to run, since often, the parent gets a
lot of things done before the child's first timeslice is allocated.

This is also quite necessary for pseudo-tty initialization, which needs
to take place before the parent writes to the child via pty.  Writes
that occur before the pty is set up can get lost.

A final, minor, nicety is that debugging output from the child will be
emitted before the parent continues on, making for much clearer debugging
output in complex situations.

The only drawback I can conceive of is that the parent can't continue to
operate while the child is being initted.  If this ever becomes a
problem in the field, we can implement an option to avoid this behavior,
but I don't expect it to.

B<Win32>: executing CODE references isn't supported on Win32, see
L</Win32 LIMITATIONS> for details.

=head2 Syntax

run(), start(), and harness() can all take a harness specification
as input.  A harness specification is either a single string to be passed
to the systems' shell:

   run "echo 'hi there'";

or a list of commands, io operations, and/or timers/timeouts to execute.
Consecutive commands must be separated by a pipe operator '|' or an '&'.
External commands are passed in as array references, and, on systems
supporting fork(), Perl code may be passed in as subs:

   run \@cmd;
   run \@cmd1, '|', \@cmd2;
   run \@cmd1, '&', \@cmd2;
   run \&sub1;
   run \&sub1, '|', \&sub2;
   run \&sub1, '&', \&sub2;

'|' pipes the stdout of \@cmd1 the stdin of \@cmd2, just like a
shell pipe.  '&' does not.  Child processes to the right of a '&'
will have their stdin closed unless it's redirected-to.

L<IPC::Run::IO> objects may be passed in as well, whether or not
child processes are also specified:

   run io( "infile", ">", \$in ), io( "outfile", "<", \$in );
      
as can L<IPC::Run::Timer> objects:

   run \@cmd, io( "outfile", "<", \$in ), timeout( 10 );

Commands may be followed by scalar, sub, or i/o handle references for
redirecting
child process input & output:

   run \@cmd,  \undef,            \$out;
   run \@cmd,  \$in,              \$out;
   run \@cmd1, \&in, '|', \@cmd2, \*OUT;
   run \@cmd1, \*IN, '|', \@cmd2, \&out;

This is known as succinct redirection syntax, since run(), start()
and harness(), figure out which file descriptor to redirect and how.
File descriptor 0 is presumed to be an input for
the child process, all others are outputs.  The assumed file
descriptor always starts at 0, unless the command is being piped to,
in which case it starts at 1.

To be explicit about your redirects, or if you need to do more complex
things, there's also a redirection operator syntax:

   run \@cmd, '<', \undef, '>',  \$out;
   run \@cmd, '<', \undef, '>&', \$out_and_err;
   run(
      \@cmd1,
         '<', \$in,
      '|', \@cmd2,
         \$out
   );

Operator syntax is required if you need to do something other than simple
redirection to/from scalars or subs, like duping or closing file descriptors
or redirecting to/from a named file.  The operators are covered in detail
below.

After each \@cmd (or \&foo), parsing begins in succinct mode and toggles to
operator syntax mode when an operator (ie plain scalar, not a ref) is seen.
Once in
operator syntax mode, parsing only reverts to succinct mode when a '|' or
'&' is seen.

In succinct mode, each parameter after the \@cmd specifies what to
do with the next highest file descriptor. These File descriptor start
with 0 (stdin) unless stdin is being piped to (C<'|', \@cmd>), in which
case they start with 1 (stdout).  Currently, being on the left of
a pipe (C<\@cmd, \$out, \$err, '|'>) does I<not> cause stdout to be
skipped, though this may change since it's not as DWIMerly as it
could be.  Only stdin is assumed to be an
input in succinct mode, all others are assumed to be outputs.

If no piping or redirection is specified for a child, it will inherit
the parent's open file handles as dictated by your system's
close-on-exec behavior and the $^F flag, except that processes after a
'&' will not inherit the parent's stdin. Also note that $^F does not
affect file desciptors obtained via POSIX, since it only applies to
full-fledged Perl file handles.  Such processes will have their stdin
closed unless it has been redirected-to.

If you want to close a child processes stdin, you may do any of:

   run \@cmd, \undef;
   run \@cmd, \"";
   run \@cmd, '<&-';
   run \@cmd, '0<&-';

Redirection is done by placing redirection specifications immediately 
after a command or child subroutine:

   run \@cmd1,      \$in, '|', \@cmd2,      \$out;
   run \@cmd1, '<', \$in, '|', \@cmd2, '>', \$out;

If you omit the redirection operators, descriptors are counted
starting at 0.  Descriptor 0 is assumed to be input, all others
are outputs.  A leading '|' consumes descriptor 0, so this
works as expected.

   run \@cmd1, \$in, '|', \@cmd2, \$out;
   
The parameter following a redirection operator can be a scalar ref,
a subroutine ref, a file name, an open filehandle, or a closed
filehandle.

If it's a scalar ref, the child reads input from or sends output to
that variable:

   $in = "Hello World.\n";
   run \@cat, \$in, \$out;
   print $out;

Scalars used in incremental (start()/pump()/finish()) applications are treated
as queues: input is removed from input scalers, resulting in them dwindling
to '', and output is appended to output scalars.  This is not true of 
harnesses run() in batch mode.

It's usually wise to append new input to be sent to the child to the input
queue, and you'll often want to zap output queues to '' before pumping.

   $h = start \@cat, \$in;
   $in = "line 1\n";
   pump $h;
   $in .= "line 2\n";
   pump $h;
   $in .= "line 3\n";
   finish $h;

The final call to finish() must be there: it allows the child process(es)
to run to completion and waits for their exit values.

=head1 OBSTINATE CHILDREN

Interactive applications are usually optimized for human use.  This
can help or hinder trying to interact with them through modules like
IPC::Run.  Frequently, programs alter their behavior when they detect
that stdin, stdout, or stderr are not connected to a tty, assuming that
they are being run in batch mode.  Whether this helps or hurts depends
on which optimizations change.  And there's often no way of telling
what a program does in these areas other than trial and error and,
occasionally, reading the source.  This includes different versions
and implementations of the same program.

All hope is not lost, however.  Most programs behave in reasonably
tractable manners, once you figure out what it's trying to do.

Here are some of the issues you might need to be aware of.

=over

=item *

fflush()ing stdout and stderr

This lets the user see stdout and stderr immediately.  Many programs
undo this optimization if stdout is not a tty, making them harder to
manage by things like IPC::Run.

Many programs decline to fflush stdout or stderr if they do not
detect a tty there.  Some ftp commands do this, for instance.

If this happens to you, look for a way to force interactive behavior,
like a command line switch or command.  If you can't, you will
need to use a pseudo terminal ('<pty<' and '>pty>').

=item *

false prompts

Interactive programs generally do not guarantee that output from user
commands won't contain a prompt string.  For example, your shell prompt
might be a '$', and a file named '$' might be the only file in a directory
listing.

This can make it hard to guarantee that your output parser won't be fooled
into early termination of results.

To help work around this, you can see if the program can alter it's 
prompt, and use something you feel is never going to occur in actual
practice.

You should also look for your prompt to be the only thing on a line:

   pump $h until $out =~ /^<SILLYPROMPT>\s?\z/m;

(use C<(?!\n)\Z> in place of C<\z> on older perls).

You can also take the approach that IPC::ChildSafe takes and emit a
command with known output after each 'real' command you issue, then
look for this known output.  See new_appender() and new_chunker() for
filters that can help with this task.

If it's not convenient or possibly to alter a prompt or use a known
command/response pair, you might need to autodetect the prompt in case
the local version of the child program is different then the one
you tested with, or if the user has control over the look & feel of
the prompt.

=item *

Refusing to accept input unless stdin is a tty.

Some programs, for security reasons, will only accept certain types
of input from a tty.  su, notable, will not prompt for a password unless
it's connected to a tty.

If this is your situation, use a pseudo terminal ('<pty<' and '>pty>').

=item *

Not prompting unless connected to a tty.

Some programs don't prompt unless stdin or stdout is a tty.  See if you can
turn prompting back on.  If not, see if you can come up with a command that
you can issue after every real command and look for it's output, as
IPC::ChildSafe does.   There are two filters included with IPC::Run that
can help with doing this: appender and chunker (see new_appender() and
new_chunker()).

=item *

Different output format when not connected to a tty.

Some commands alter their formats to ease machine parsability when they
aren't connected to a pipe.  This is actually good, but can be surprising.

=back

=head1 PSEUDO TERMINALS

On systems providing pseudo terminals under /dev, IPC::Run can use IO::Pty
(available on CPAN) to provide a terminal environment to subprocesses.
This is necessary when the subprocess really wants to think it's connected
to a real terminal.

=head2 CAVEATS

Psuedo-terminals are not pipes, though they are similar.  Here are some
differences to watch out for.

=over

=item Echoing

Sending to stdin will cause an echo on stdout, which occurs before each
line is passed to the child program.  There is currently no way to
disable this, although the child process can and should disable it for
things like passwords.

=item Shutdown

IPC::Run cannot close a pty until all output has been collected.  This
means that it is not possible to send an EOF to stdin by half-closing
the pty, as we can when using a pipe to stdin.

This means that you need to send the child process an exit command or
signal, or run() / finish() will time out.  Be careful not to expect a
prompt after sending the exit command.

=item Command line editing

Some subprocesses, notable shells that depend on the user's prompt
settings, will reissue the prompt plus the command line input so far
once for each character.

=item '>pty>' means '&>pty>', not '1>pty>'

The pseudo terminal redirects both stdout and stderr unless you specify
a file descriptor.  If you want to grab stderr separately, do this:

   start \@cmd, '<pty<', \$in, '>pty>', \$out, '2>', \$err;

=item stdin, stdout, and stderr not inherited

Child processes harnessed to a pseudo terminal have their stdin, stdout,
and stderr completely closed before any redirection operators take
effect.  This casts of the bonds of the controlling terminal.  This is
not done when using pipes.

Right now, this affects all children in a harness that has a pty in use,
even if that pty would not affect a particular child.  That's a bug and
will be fixed.  Until it is, it's best not to mix-and-match children.

=back

   <pipe, N<pipe     P   Pipe opens H for caller to read, write, close.
   >pipe, N>pipe     P   Pipe opens H for caller to read, write, close.
                      
'N' and 'M' are placeholders for integer file descriptor numbers.  The
terms 'input' and 'output' are from the child process's perspective.

The SHNP field indicates what parameters an operator can take:

   S: \$scalar or \&function references.  Filters may be used with
      these operators (and only these).
   H: \*HANDLE or IO::Handle for caller to open, and close
   N: "file name".
   P: \*HANDLE opened by IPC::Run as the parent end of a pipe, but read
      and written to and closed by the caller (like IPC::Open3).

=item Redirecting input: [n]<, [n]<pipe

You can input the child reads on file descriptor number n to come from a
scalar variable, subroutine, file handle, or a named file.  If stdin
is not redirected, the parent's stdin is inherited.

   run \@cat, \undef          ## Closes child's stdin immediately
      or die "cat returned $?"; 

   run \@cat, \$in;

   run \@cat, \<<TOHERE;
   blah
   TOHERE

   run \@cat, \&input;       ## Calls &input, feeding data returned
                              ## to child's.  Closes child's stdin
                              ## when undef is returned.

Redirecting from named files requires you to use the input
redirection operator:

   run \@cat, '<.profile';
   run \@cat, '<', '.profile';

   open IN, "<foo";
   run \@cat, \*IN;
   run \@cat, *IN{IO};

The form used second example here is the safest,
since filenames like "0" and "&more\n" won't confuse &run:

You can't do either of

   run \@a, *IN;      ## INVALID
   run \@a, '<', *IN; ## BUGGY: Reads file named like "*main::A"
   
because perl passes a scalar containing a string that
looks like "*main::A" to &run, and &run can't tell the difference
between that and a redirection operator or a file name.  &run guarantees
that any scalar you pass after a redirection operator is a file name.

If your child process will take input from file descriptors other
than 0 (stdin), you can use a redirection operator with any of the
valid input forms (scalar ref, sub ref, etc.):

   run \@cat, '3<', \$in3;

When redirecting input from a scalar ref, the scalar ref is
used as a queue.  This allows you to use &harness and pump() to
feed incremental bits of input to a coprocess.  See L</Coprocesses>
below for more information.

The <pipe operator opens the write half of a pipe on the filehandle
glob reference it takes as an argument:

   $h = start \@cat, '<pipe', \*IN;
   print IN "hello world\n";
   pump $h;
   close IN;
   finish $h;

Unlike the other '<' operators, IPC::Run does nothing further with
it: you are responsible for it.  The previous example is functionally
equivalent to:

   pipe( \*R, \*IN ) or die $!;
   $h = start \@cat, '<', \*IN;
   print IN "hello world\n";
   pump $h;
   close IN;
   finish $h;

This is like the behavior of IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3.

B<Win32>: The handle returned is actually a socket handle, so you can
use select() on it.

=item Redirecting output: [n]>, [n]>>, [n]>&[m], [n]>pipe

You can redirect any output the child emits
to a scalar variable, subroutine, file handle, or file name.  You
can have &run truncate or append to named files or scalars.  If
you are redirecting stdin as well, or if the command is on the
receiving end of a pipeline ('|'), you can omit the redirection
operator:

   @ls = ( 'ls' );
   run \@ls, \undef, \$out
      or die "ls returned $?"; 

   run \@ls, \undef, \&out;  ## Calls &out each time some output
                              ## is received from the child's 
                              ## when undef is returned.

   run \@ls, \undef, '2>ls.err';
   run \@ls, '2>', 'ls.err';

The two parameter form guarantees that the filename
will not be interpreted as a redirection operator:

   run \@ls, '>', "&more";
   run \@ls, '2>', ">foo\n";

You can pass file handles you've opened for writing:

   open( *OUT, ">out.txt" );
   open( *ERR, ">err.txt" );
   run \@cat, \*OUT, \*ERR;

Passing a scalar reference and a code reference requires a little
more work, but allows you to capture all of the output in a scalar
or each piece of output by a callback:

These two do the same things:

   run( [ 'ls' ], '2>', sub { $err_out .= $_[0] } );

does the same basic thing as:

   run( [ 'ls' ], '2>', \$err_out );

The subroutine will be called each time some data is read from the child.

The >pipe operator is different in concept than the other '>' operators,
although it's syntax is similar:

   $h = start \@cat, $in, '>pipe', \*OUT, '2>pipe', \*ERR;
   $in = "hello world\n";
   finish $h;
   print <OUT>;
   print <ERR>;
   close OUT;
   close ERR;

causes two pipe to be created, with one end attached to cat's stdout
and stderr, respectively, and the other left open on OUT and ERR, so
that the script can manually
read(), select(), etc. on them.  This is like
the behavior of IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3.

B<Win32>: The handle returned is actually a socket handle, so you can
use select() on it.

=item Duplicating output descriptors: >&m, n>&m

This duplicates output descriptor number n (default is 1 if n is omitted)
from descriptor number m.

=item Duplicating input descriptors: <&m, n<&m

This duplicates input descriptor number n (default is 0 if n is omitted)
from descriptor number m

=item Closing descriptors: <&-, 3<&-

This closes descriptor number n (default is 0 if n is omitted).  The
following commands are equivalent:

   run \@cmd, \undef;
   run \@cmd, '<&-';
   run \@cmd, '<in.txt', '<&-';

Doing

   run \@cmd, \$in, '<&-';    ## SIGPIPE recipe.

is dangerous: the parent will get a SIGPIPE if $in is not empty.

=item Redirecting both stdout and stderr: &>, >&, &>pipe, >pipe&

The following pairs of commands are equivalent:

   run \@cmd, '>&', \$out;       run \@cmd, '>', \$out,     '2>&1';
   run \@cmd, '>&', 'out.txt';   run \@cmd, '>', 'out.txt', '2>&1';

etc.

File descriptor numbers are not permitted to the left or the right of
these operators, and the '&' may occur on either end of the operator.

The '&>pipe' and '>pipe&' variants behave like the '>pipe' operator, except
that both stdout and stderr write to the created pipe.

=item Redirection Filters

Both input redirections and output redirections that use scalars or
subs as endpoints may have an arbitrary number of filter subs placed
between them and the child process.  This is useful if you want to
receive output in chunks, or if you want to massage each chunk of
data sent to the child.  To use this feature, you must use operator
syntax:

   run(
      \@cmd
         '<', \&in_filter_2, \&in_filter_1, $in,
         '>', \&out_filter_1, \&in_filter_2, $out,
   );

This capability is not provided for IO handles or named files.

Two filters are provided by IPC::Run: appender and chunker.  Because
these may take an argument, you need to use the constructor functions
new_appender() and new_chunker() rather than using \& syntax:

   run(
      \@cmd
         '<', new_appender( "\n" ), $in,
         '>', new_chunker, $out,
   );

=back

=head2 Just doing I/O

If you just want to do I/O to a handle or file you open yourself, you
may specify a filehandle or filename instead of a command in the harness
specification:

   run io( "filename", '>', \$recv );

   $h = start io( $io, '>', \$recv );

   $h = harness \@cmd, '&', io( "file", '<', \$send );

=head2 Options

Options are passed in as name/value pairs:

   run \@cat, \$in, debug => 1;

If you pass the debug option, you may want to pass it in first, so you
can see what parsing is going on:

   run debug => 1, \@cat, \$in;

=over

=item debug

Enables debugging output in parent and child.  Debugging info is emitted
to the STDERR that was present when IPC::Run was first C<use()>ed (it's
C<dup()>ed out of the way so that it can be redirected in children without
having debugging output emitted on it).

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

harness() and start() return a reference to an IPC::Run harness.  This is
blessed in to the IPC::Run package, so you may make later calls to
functions as members if you like:

   $h = harness( ... );
   $h->start;
   $h->pump;
   $h->finish;

   $h = start( .... );
   $h->pump;
   ...

Of course, using method call syntax lets you deal with any IPC::Run
subclasses that might crop up, but don't hold your breath waiting for
any.

run() and finish() return TRUE when all subcommands exit with a 0 result
code.  B<This is the opposite of perl's system() command>.

All routines raise exceptions (via die()) when error conditions are
recognized.  A non-zero command result is not treated as an error
condition, since some commands are tests whose results are reported 
in their exit codes.

=item run

Run takes a harness or harness specification and runs it, pumping
all input to the child(ren), closing the input pipes when no more
input is available, collecting all output that arrives, until the
pipes delivering output are closed, then waiting for the children to
exit and reaping their result codes.

You may think of C<run( ... )> as being like 

   start( ... )->finish();

, though there is one subtle difference: run() does not
set \$input_scalars to '' like finish() does.  If an exception is thrown
from run(), all children will be killed off "gently", and then "annihilated"
if they do not go gently (in to that dark night. sorry).

If any exceptions are thrown, this does a L</kill_kill> before propogating
them.

=item signal

   ## To send it a specific signal by name ("USR1"):
   signal $h, "USR1";
   $h->signal ( "USR1" );

If $signal is provided and defined, sends a signal to all child processes.  Try
not to send numeric signals, use C<"KILL"> instead of C<9>, for instance.
Numeric signals aren't portable.

Throws an exception if $signal is undef.

This will I<not> clean up the harness, C<finish> it if you kill it.

Normally TERM kills a process gracefully (this is what the command line utility
C<kill> does by default), INT is sent by one of the keys C<^C>, C<Backspace> or
C<E<lt>DelE<gt>>, and C<QUIT> is used to kill a process and make it coredump.

The C<HUP> signal is often used to get a process to "restart", rereading 
config files, and C<USR1> and C<USR2> for really application-specific things.

Often, running C<kill -l> (that's a lower case "L") on the command line will
list the signals present on your operating system.

B<WARNING>: The signal subsystem is not at all portable.  We *may* offer
to simulate C<TERM> and C<KILL> on some operating systems, submit code
to me if you want this.

B<WARNING 2>: Up to and including perl v5.6.1, doing almost anything in a
signal handler could be dangerous.  The most safe code avoids all
mallocs and system calls, usually by preallocating a flag before
entering the signal handler, altering the flag's value in the
handler, and responding to the changed value in the main system:

   my $got_usr1 = 0;
   sub usr1_handler { ++$got_signal }

   $SIG{USR1} = \&usr1_handler;
   while () { sleep 1; print "GOT IT" while $got_usr1--; }

Even this approach is perilous if ++ and -- aren't atomic on your system
(I've never heard of this on any modern CPU large enough to run perl).

=item kill_kill

   ## To kill off a process:
   $h->kill_kill;
   kill_kill $h;

   ## To specify the grace period other than 30 seconds:
   kill_kill $h, grace => 5;

   ## To send QUIT instead of KILL if a process refuses to die:
   kill_kill $h, coup_d_grace => "QUIT";

Sends a C<TERM>, waits for all children to exit for up to 30 seconds, then
sends a C<KILL> to any that survived the C<TERM>.

Will wait for up to 30 more seconds for the OS to successfully C<KILL> the
processes.

The 30 seconds may be overridden by setting the C<grace> option, this
overrides both timers.

The harness is then cleaned up.

The doubled name indicates that this function may kill again and avoids
colliding with the core Perl C<kill> function.

Returns a 1 if the C<TERM> was sufficient, or a 0 if C<KILL> was 
required.  Throws an exception if C<KILL> did not permit the children
to be reaped.

B<NOTE>: The grace period is actually up to 1 second longer than that
given.  This is because the granularity of C<time> is 1 second.  Let me
know if you need finer granularity, we can leverage Time::HiRes here.

B<Win32>: Win32 does not know how to send real signals, so C<TERM> is
a full-force kill on Win32.  Thus all talk of grace periods, etc. do
not apply to Win32.

=item harness

Takes a harness specification and returns a harness.  This harness is
blessed in to IPC::Run, allowing you to use method call syntax for
run(), start(), et al if you like.

harness() is provided so that you can pre-build harnesses if you
would like to, but it's not required..

You may proceed to run(), start() or pump() after calling harness() (pump()
calls start() if need be).  Alternatively, you may pass your
harness specification to run() or start() and let them harness() for
you.  You can't pass harness specifications to pump(), though.

start() accepts a harness or harness specification and returns a harness
after building all of the pipes and launching (via fork()/exec(), or, maybe
someday, spawn()) all the child processes.  It does not send or receive any
data on the pipes, see pump() and finish() for that.

You may call harness() and then pass it's result to start() if you like,
but you only need to if it helps you structure or tune your application.
If you do call harness(), you may skip start() and proceed directly to
pump.

start() also starts all timers in the harness.  See L<IPC::Run::Timer>
for more information.

start() flushes STDOUT and STDERR to help you avoid duplicate output.
It has no way of asking Perl to flush all your open filehandles, so
you are going to need to flush any others you have open.  Sorry.

Here's how if you don't want to alter the state of $| for your
filehandle:

   $ofh = select HANDLE; $of = $|; $| = 1; $| = $of; select $ofh;

If you don't mind leaving output unbuffered on HANDLE, you can do
the slightly shorter

   $ofh = select HANDLE; $| = 1; select $ofh;

Or, you can use IO::Handle's flush() method:

   use IO::Handle;
   flush HANDLE;

Perl needs the equivalent of C's fflush( (FILE *)NULL ).

=item pump

   pump $h;
   $h->pump;

Pump accepts a single parameter harness.  It blocks until it delivers some
input or recieves some output.  It returns TRUE if there is still input or
output to be done, FALSE otherwise.

pump() will automatically call start() if need be, so you may call harness()
then proceed to pump() if that helps you structure your application.

If pump() is called after all harnessed activities have completed, a "process
ended prematurely" exception to be thrown.  This allows for simple scripting
of external applications without having to add lots of error handling code at
each step of the script:

   $h = harness \@smbclient, \$in, \$out, $err;

   $in = "cd /foo\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/m;
   die "error cding to /foo:\n$out" if $out =~ "ERR";
   $out = '';

   $in = "mget *\n";
   $h->pump until $out =~ /^smb.*> \Z/m;

=item finish

This must be called after the last start() or pump() call for a harness,
or your system will accumulate defunct processes and you may "leak"
file descriptors.

finish() returns TRUE if all children returned 0 (and were not signaled and did
not coredump, ie ! $?), and FALSE otherwise (this is like run(), and the
opposite of system()).

Once a harness has been finished, it may be run() or start()ed again,
including by pump()s auto-start.

If this throws an exception rather than a normal exit, the harness may
be left in an unstable state, it's best to kill the harness to get rid
of all the child processes, etc.

Specifically, if a timeout expires in finish(), finish() will not
kill all the children.  Call C<<$h->kill_kill>> in this case if you care.
This differs from the behavior of L</run>.

=head1 FILTERS

These filters are used to modify input our output between a child
process and a scalar or subroutine endpoint.

=over

=item binary

   run \@cmd, ">", binary, \$out;
   run \@cmd, ">", binary, \$out;  ## Any TRUE value to enable
   run \@cmd, ">", binary 0, \$out;  ## Any FALSE value to disable

This is a constructor for a "binmode" "filter" that tells IPC::Run to keep
the carriage returns that would ordinarily be edited out for you (binmode
is usually off).  This is not a real filter, but an option masquerading as
a filter.

It's not named "binmode" because you're likely to want to call Perl's binmode
in programs that are piping binary data around.

=cut

sub binary(;$) {
   my $enable = @_ ? shift : 1;
   return bless sub { $enable }, "IPC::Run::binmode_pseudo_filter";
}

=pod

=item new_chunker

This breaks a stream of data in to chunks, based on an optional
scalar or regular expression parameter.  The default is the Perl
input record separator in $/, which is a newline be default.

   run \@cmd, '>', new_chunker, \&lines_handler;
   run \@cmd, '>', new_chunker( "\r\n" ), \&lines_handler;

Because this uses $/ by default, you should always pass in a parameter
if you are worried about other code (modules, etc) modifying $/.

If this filter is last in a filter chain that dumps in to a scalar,
the scalar must be set to '' before a new chunk will be written to it.

As an example of how a filter like this can be written, here's a
chunker that splits on newlines:

   sub line_splitter {
      my ( $in_ref, $out_ref ) = @_;

      return 0 if length $$out_ref;

      return input_avail && do {
         while (1) {
            if ( $$in_ref =~ s/\A(.*?\n)// ) {
               $$out_ref .= $1;
               return 1;
            }
            my $hmm = get_more_input;
            unless ( defined $hmm ) {
               $$out_ref = $$in_ref;
               $$in_ref = '';
               return length $$out_ref ? 1 : 0;
            }
            return 0 if $hmm eq 0;
         }
      }
   };

=cut

sub new_chunker(;$) {
   my ( $re ) = @_;
   $re = $/ if _empty $re;
   $re = quotemeta( $re ) unless ref $re eq 'Regexp';
   $re = qr/\A(.*?$re)/s;

   return sub {
      my ( $in_ref, $out_ref ) = @_;

      return 0 if length $$out_ref;

      return input_avail && do {
         while (1) {
            if ( $$in_ref =~ s/$re// ) {
               $$out_ref .= $1;
               return 1;
            }
            my $hmm = get_more_input;
            unless ( defined $hmm ) {
               $$out_ref = $$in_ref;
               $$in_ref = '';

            return 0 if $hmm eq 0;
         }
      }
   };

=item new_appender

This appends a fixed string to each chunk of data read from the source
scalar or sub.  This might be useful if you're writing commands to a
child process that always must end in a fixed string, like "\n":

   run( \@cmd,
      '<', new_appender( "\n" ), \&commands,
   );

Here's a typical filter sub that might be created by new_appender():

   sub newline_appender {
      my ( $in_ref, $out_ref ) = @_;

      return input_avail && do {
         $$out_ref = join( '', $$out_ref, $$in_ref, "\n" );
         $$in_ref = '';
         1;
      }
   };

=cut

sub new_appender($) {
   my ( $suffix ) = @_;
   croak "\$suffix undefined" unless defined $suffix;

   return sub {
      my ( $in_ref, $out_ref ) = @_;

      return input_avail && do {
         $$out_ref = join( '', $$out_ref, $$in_ref, $suffix );
         $$in_ref = '';
         1;
      }
   };

=item new_string_source

TODO: Needs confirmation. Was previously undocumented. in this module.

This is a filter which is exportable. Returns a sub which appends the data passed in to the output buffer and returns 1 if data was appended. 0 if it was an empty string and undef if no data was passed. 

NOTE: Any additional variables passed to new_string_source will be passed to the sub every time it's called and appended to the output.

#=item timeout
#
#This function defines a time interval, starting from when start() is
#called, or when timeout() is called.  If all processes have not finished
#by the end of the timeout period, then a "process timed out" exception
#is thrown.
#
#The time interval may be passed in seconds, or as an end time in
#"HH:MM:SS" format (any non-digit other than '.' may be used as
#spacing and puctuation).  This is probably best shown by example:
#
#   $h->timeout( $val );
#
#   $val                     Effect
#   ======================== =====================================
#   undef                    Timeout timer disabled
#   ''                       Almost immediate timeout
#   0                        Almost immediate timeout
#   0.000001                 timeout > 0.0000001 seconds
#   30                       timeout > 30 seconds
#   30.0000001               timeout > 30 seconds
#   10:30                    timeout > 10 minutes, 30 seconds
#
#Timeouts are currently evaluated with a 1 second resolution, though
#this may change in the future.  This means that setting
#timeout($h,1) will cause a pokey child to be aborted sometime after
#one second has elapsed and typically before two seconds have elapsed.
#
#This sub does not check whether or not the timeout has expired already.
#
#Returns the number of seconds set as the timeout (this does not change
#as time passes, unless you call timeout( val ) again).
#
#The timeout does not include the time needed to fork() or spawn()
#the child processes, though some setup time for the child processes can
#included.  It also does not include the length of time it takes for
#the children to exit after they've closed all their pipes to the

Instantiates a non-fatal timer.  pump() returns once each time a timer
expires.  Has no direct effect on run(), but you can pass a subroutine
to fire when the timer expires. 

See L</timeout> for building timers that throw exceptions on
expiration.

   pump $h until $out =~ /expected stuff/;

Instantiates a timer that throws an exception when it expires.
If you don't provide an exception, a default exception that matches
/^IPC::Run: .*timed out/ is thrown by default.  You can pass in your own
exception scalar or reference:

   $h = start(
      \@cmd, \$in, \$out,
      $t = timeout( 5, exception => 'slowpoke' ),
   );

or set the name used in debugging message and in the default exception
string:

   $h = start(
      \@cmd, \$in, \$out,
      timeout( 50, name => 'process timer' ),
      $stall_timer = timeout( 5, name => 'stall timer' ),

=head1 FILTER IMPLEMENTATION FUNCTIONS

These functions are for use from within filters.

=over

=item input_avail

Returns TRUE if input is available.  If none is available, then 
&get_more_input is called and its result is returned.

This is usually used in preference to &get_more_input so that the
calling filter removes all data from the $in_ref before more data
gets read in to $in_ref.

C<input_avail> is usually used as part of a return expression:

   return input_avail && do {
      ## process the input just gotten
      1;
   };

This technique allows input_avail to return the undef or 0 that a
filter normally returns when there's no input to process.  If a filter
stores intermediate values, however, it will need to react to an
undef:

   my $got = input_avail;
   if ( ! defined $got ) {
      ## No more input ever, flush internal buffers to $out_ref
   }
   return $got unless $got;
   ## Got some input, move as much as need be
   return 1 if $added_to_out_ref;

=cut

sub input_avail() {
   confess "Undefined FBUF ref for $filter_num+1"
      unless defined $filter_op->{FBUFS}->[$filter_num+1];
   length ${$filter_op->{FBUFS}->[$filter_num+1]} || get_more_input;
}

=pod

=item get_more_input

This is used to fetch more input in to the input variable.  It returns
undef if there will never be any more input, 0 if there is none now,
but there might be in the future, and TRUE if more input was gotten.

C<get_more_input> is usually used as part of a return expression,
see L</input_avail> for more information.

=cut

=head1 TODO

These will be addressed as needed and as time allows.

Stall timeout.

Expose a list of child process objects.  When I do this,
each child process is likely to be blessed into IPC::Run::Proc.

$kid->abort(), $kid->kill(), $kid->signal( $num_or_name ).

Write tests for /(full_)?results?/ subs.

Currently, pump() and run() only work on systems where select() works on the
filehandles returned by pipe().  This does *not* include ActiveState on Win32,
although it does work on cygwin under Win32 (thought the tests whine a bit).
I'd like to rectify that, suggestions and patches welcome.

Likewise start() only fully works on fork()/exec() machines (well, just
fork() if you only ever pass perl subs as subprocesses).  There's
some scaffolding for calling Open3::spawn_with_handles(), but that's
untested, and not that useful with limited select().

Support for C<\@sub_cmd> as an argument to a command which
gets replaced with /dev/fd or the name of a temporary file containing foo's
output.  This is like <(sub_cmd ...) found in bash and csh (IIRC).

Allow multiple harnesses to be combined as independent sets of processes
in to one 'meta-harness'.

Allow a harness to be passed in place of an \@cmd.  This would allow
multiple harnesses to be aggregated.

Ability to add external file descriptors w/ filter chains and endpoints.

Ability to add timeouts and timing generators (i.e. repeating timeouts).

High resolution timeouts.

=head1 Win32 LIMITATIONS

=over

=item Fails on Win9X

If you want Win9X support, you'll have to debug it or fund me because I
don't use that system any more.  The Win32 subsysem has been extended to
use temporary files in simple run() invocations and these may actually
work on Win9X too, but I don't have time to work on it.

=item May deadlock on Win2K (but not WinNT4 or WinXPPro)

Spawning more than one subprocess on Win2K causes a deadlock I haven't
figured out yet, but simple uses of run() often work.  Passes all tests
on WinXPPro and WinNT.

=item no support yet for <pty< and >pty>

These are likely to be implemented as "<" and ">" with binmode on, not
sure.

=item no support for file descriptors higher than 2 (stderr)

Win32 only allows passing explicit fds 0, 1, and 2.  If you really, really need to pass file handles, us Win32API:: GetOsFHandle() or ::FdGetOsFHandle() to
get the integer handle and pass it to the child process using the command
line, environment, stdin, intermediary file, or other IPC mechnism.  Then
use that handle in the child (Win32API.pm provides ways to reconstitute
Perl file handles from Win32 file handles).

=item no support for subroutine subprocesses (CODE refs)

Can't fork(), so the subroutines would have no context, and closures certainly
have no meaning

Perhaps with Win32 fork() emulation, this can be supported in a limited
fashion, but there are other very serious problems with that: all parent
fds get dup()ed in to the thread emulating the forked process, and that
keeps the parent from being able to close all of the appropriate fds.

=item no support for init => sub {} routines.

Win32 processes are created from scratch, there is no way to do an init
routine that will affect the running child.  Some limited support might
be implemented one day, do chdir() and %ENV changes can be made.

=item signals

Win32 does not fully support signals.  signal() is likely to cause errors
unless sending a signal that Perl emulates, and C<kill_kill()> is immediately
fatal (there is no grace period).

=item helper processes

IPC::Run uses helper processes, one per redirected file, to adapt between the
anonymous pipe connected to the child and the TCP socket connected to the
parent.  This is a waste of resources and will change in the future to either
use threads (instead of helper processes) or a WaitForMultipleObjects call
(instead of select).  Please contact me if you can help with the
WaitForMultipleObjects() approach; I haven't figured out how to get at it
without C code.

=item shutdown pause

There seems to be a pause of up to 1 second between when a child program exits
and the corresponding sockets indicate that they are closed in the parent.
Not sure why.

=item binmode

binmode is not supported yet.  The underpinnings are implemented, just ask
if you need it.

=item IPC::Run::IO

IPC::Run::IO objects can be used on Unix to read or write arbitrary files.  On
Win32, they will need to use the same helper processes to adapt from
non-select()able filehandles to select()able ones (or perhaps
WaitForMultipleObjects() will work with them, not sure).

=item startup race conditions

There seems to be an occasional race condition between child process startup
and pipe closings.  It seems like if the child is not fully created by the time
CreateProcess returns and we close the TCP socket being handed to it, the
parent socket can also get closed.  This is seen with the Win32 pumper
applications, not the "real" child process being spawned.

I assume this is because the kernel hasn't gotten around to incrementing the
reference count on the child's end (since the child was slow in starting), so
the parent's closing of the child end causes the socket to be closed, thus
closing the parent socket.

Being a race condition, it's hard to reproduce, but I encountered it while
testing this code on a drive share to a samba box.  In this case, it takes
t/run.t a long time to spawn it's chile processes (the parent hangs in the
first select for several seconds until the child emits any debugging output).

I have not seen it on local drives, and can't reproduce it at will,
unfortunately.  The symptom is a "bad file descriptor in select()" error, and,
by turning on debugging, it's possible to see that select() is being called on
a no longer open file descriptor that was returned from the _socket() routine
in Win32Helper.  There's a new confess() that checks for this ("PARENT_HANDLE
no longer open"), but I haven't been able to reproduce it (typically).

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

On Unix, requires a system that supports C<waitpid( $pid, WNOHANG )> so
it can tell if a child process is still running.

No support for ';', '&&', '||', '{ ... }', etc: use perl's, since run()
returns TRUE when the command exits with a 0 result code.

Does not provide shell-like string interpolation.

No support for C<cd>, C<setenv>, or C<export>: do these in an init() sub

   run(
      \cmd,
         ...
         init => sub {
            chdir $dir or die $!;
            $ENV{FOO}='BAR'
         }
   );

Timeout calculation does not allow absolute times, or specification of
days, months, etc.

B<WARNING:> Function coprocesses (C<run \&foo, ...>) suffer from two
limitations.  The first is that it is difficult to close all filehandles the
child inherits from the parent, since there is no way to scan all open
FILEHANDLEs in Perl and it both painful and a bit dangerous to close all open
file descriptors with C<POSIX::close()>. Painful because we can't tell which
fds are open at the POSIX level, either, so we'd have to scan all possible fds
and close any that we don't want open (normally C<exec()> closes any
non-inheritable but we don't C<exec()> for &sub processes.

The second problem is that Perl's DESTROY subs and other on-exit cleanup gets
run in the child process.  If objects are instantiated in the parent before the
child is forked, the the DESTROY will get run once in the parent and once in
the child.  When coprocess subs exit, POSIX::exit is called to work around this,
but it means that objects that are still referred to at that time are not
cleaned up.  So setting package vars or closure vars to point to objects that
rely on DESTROY to affect things outside the process (files, etc), will
lead to bugs.

I goofed on the syntax: "<pipe" vs. "<pty<" and ">filename" are both
oddities.

=head1 TODO

=item Allow one harness to "adopt" another:

   $new_h = harness \@cmd2;
   $h->adopt( $new_h );

=item Close all filehandles not explicitly marked to stay open.

The problem with this one is that there's no good way to scan all open
FILEHANDLEs in Perl, yet you don't want child processes inheriting handles
willy-nilly.

=head1 INSPIRATION

Well, select() and waitpid() badly needed wrapping, and open3() isn't
open-minded enough for me.

The shell-like API inspired by a message Russ Allbery sent to perl5-porters,
which included:

   I've thought for some time that it would be
   nice to have a module that could handle full Bourne shell pipe syntax
   internally, with fork and exec, without ever invoking a shell.  Something
   that you could give things like:

   pipeopen (PIPE, [ qw/cat file/ ], '|', [ 'analyze', @args ], '>&3');
