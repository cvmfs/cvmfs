=head1 NAME

HTTP::Proxy::Engine::Legacy - The "older" HTTP::Proxy engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $proxy = HTTP::Proxy->new( engine => 'Legacy' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This engine reproduces the older child creation algorithm of HTTP::Proxy.

Angelos Karageorgiou C<< <angelos@unix.gr> >> reports:

I<I got the Legacy engine to work really fast under C<Win32> with the following trick:>

    max_keep_alive_requests(1);
    max_clients(120);
    $HTTP::VERSION(1.0); # just in case

I<and it smokes.>

I<It seems that forked children are really slow when calling select for handling C<keep-alive>d requests!>

=head1 METHODS

The module defines the following methods, used by HTTP::Proxy main loop:

=over 4

=item start()

Initialise the engine.

=item run()

Implements the forking logic: a new process is forked for each new
incoming TCP connection.

=item stop()

Reap remaining child processes.

=back

The following method is used by the engine internally:

=over 4

=item reap_zombies()

Process the dead child processes.

=back
