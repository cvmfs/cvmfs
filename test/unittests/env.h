 * box to child processes spawned to run death tests.
 *
 * Furthermore this class detects if it runs in a re-spawned death test process
 * and does not re-create a sandbox in that case. Obviously such death test
 * processes cannot clean up after themselves, leaving behind leaked temp files.
 * In such cases the pointer file of the parent process is read and its sandbox
 * directory is re-used.
