Installing the test system under SL6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the system did not work out of the box in my case, here are some remarks
how I convinced it to run:

1) Install.pl fails silently to compile ZeroMQ, since there is a uuid-devel
   package missing. I simply installed it using yum:

   `yum install libuuid-devel`

   After that Install.pl successfully configured and built ZeroMQ for me.

2) Cpanm is automatically installed into /usr/local/bin which is not in the
   $PATH of the root user. Thus it will not be found by Install.pl, resulting
   in an error message.
   I hotfixed Install.pl for now, to create a symlink from /usr/bin/cpanm to
   /usr/local/bin/cpanm. This is kind of a hacky solution and should be ex-
   changed. Maybe local::lib does the trick, but I wasn't able to figure out
   how. O.o

3) Install.pl tries to `chown` some stuff to a user named cvmfs-test, which
   fails, because the user was not created beforehand. In fact cvmfs-test
   will be created by the `setup` command in the cvmfs-test shell, which
   Install.pl tries to run afterwards, though.

4) Unfortunately Install.pl failed to run the cvmfs-test shell using the
   command `cvmfs-test`, since it was installed into /usr/local/bin. See (2)
   for the reason. However, the script ends and the cvmfs-test shell is working
   when you run it by hand:

   `cvmfs-test`

   In there you can run the command `setup` followed by `fixperm` which seems
   to eventually set up the environment correctly.


I hope this helps...
