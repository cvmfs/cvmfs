# Every plugin must have an help file. The line beginning with "Short:"
# will be dispalyed when the help command is invoked without any option.
# It's a good idea do not have more than one line for short description.
#
# Lines that start with "$command:" (where $command is the invoked command)
# will be displayed if the command "help command" is invoked. 
# Try to format your help and remember that usual terminal window
# consists of 80 character.
