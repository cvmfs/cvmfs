  Catalog Inspection using Python
  *******************************

The scripts in this directory are supposed to be used as tools for debugging and
inspection of CernVM-FS catalog hierarchies. They are explicitly _NOT_ intended
for heavy production usage.
The python module contained in cvmfs.py is meant to be a lean tool for easy
catalog inspection in both an interactive and a scripted setting.
