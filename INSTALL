Installation Instructions
=========================

The CernVM-FS build system uses cmake.  

In order to correctly build the system several dependencies are necessary.
The dependencies are listed inside the `packaging` directory.

For debian based system you can find the dependencies inside the `control` file under `packaging/debian/cvmfs`.

Similarly for CentOS you can find them inside `packaging/rpm/cvmfs-universal.spec`.

In order to compile and install, run from the source directory

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install

In order to build the unit tests in addition, use
`cmake -DBUILD_UNITTESTS=yes ../`

For more details, please see the [technical documentation](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
